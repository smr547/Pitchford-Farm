## Discover the Pitchford Farm in the Upper Cordeaux River

The Farm is gone and nobody has visited the site in over 50 years. I would be fun to find it and see what remain.

Here is a aerial photo of the Upper Cordeaux River (circa 1949) showing the area of the farm with farm builiding in the central area.
